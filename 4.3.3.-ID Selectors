ID SELECTORS-ID selectors are used to target an specific element.

Rules for using ID's

1.Give the target element an ID (#).
2.Use the ID as a selector in the CSS.

EXAMPLE 1:

<p id="main-content">
...
</p>

<p id="secondary-content">
...
</p>

Note: An ID cannot start with a number and cannot contain spacces. Hyphens and underscores are allowed and ID's must be unique. Do not give two different elements the same ID.

EXAMPLE 2:

#main-content {
font-weight:bold;
}

#secondary-content {
font-style:italic;
}
