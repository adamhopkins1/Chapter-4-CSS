CSS PRIORITIES- THE MORE SPECIFIC THE SELECTOR, THE HIGHER PRIORITY IT HAS.

1.ID selectors have more specificity than a class selector.

2.Class selectors have more specificity than an element selector

EXAMPLE:

p {                     (THIRD PRIORITY)
background-color:blue;
}

.custom-bg-black {      (SECOND PRIORITY)
backgroun-color:black;
}

#main-content {        (MOST PRIORITY)
background-color:red;
}

EXAMPLE 2:

<p id="main-content" class="custom-bg-black">
...
</p>

RESULT OF EXAMPLE 2: THE BACKGORUND-COLOR RED WILL BE THE COLOR CHOSEN BECAUSE THE ID (#) IS THE MOST SPECIFIC.
THE CLASS SELECTORS AND THE ELEMENT SELECTOR WILL BE IGNORED BY CSS.

3.If selectors are of equal priority, the one declared last, is selected.

EXAMPLE 3:

p {
background-color:black;
}

p {
background-color:blue;
}

RESULT OF EXAMPLE 3: BECAUSE THE SELECTOR WITH THE BACKGROUND-COLOR:BLUE WAS THE 2ND HTML SELECTOR
CSS WILL CHOOSE THE LAST WRITTEN SELECTOR OVER THE FIRST HTML SELECTOR WHICH IS IGNORED.
