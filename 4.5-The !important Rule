THE ! IMPORTANT RULE IS NECESSARYY WHEN THE CSS PRIORITY RULE NEEDS TO BE OVERWRITTEN AND A CLASS, ELEMENT
OR ID SELECTOR CAN HAVE PRIORITY OVER AN ENTIRE STYLING PRIORITY IN CSS.

EXAMPLE 1:

P {
color:red !important;
}

.highlight {
color:green;
}


RESULT OF EXAMPLE 1: BECAUSE OF THE ! IMPORTANT TAG FOR THE 1ST ELEMENT SELECTOR THE PAGE WILL BE THE COLOR RED
DUE TO THE VALUE WITH THE (!) IMPORTANT OVERRIDES THE 2ND CLASS AS PRIORITY AND THE 2ND CLASS IS IGNORED AND THE FIRST 
CLASS IS GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY.
